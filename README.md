## Relationship between estrogen receptor signaling and immune evasion

This repository contains codes used for a manuscript, 
"An estrogen receptor signaling transcriptional program linked to immune evasion in human hormone receptor-positive breast cancer"
 (Shimada, *et al.*).

Note:
Certain paths were set in `.Rprofile` file, which is not shared in this repository. To reproduce the codes, each user should prepare the following in one's environment.

- `data_dir` raw data, flat files mostly
- `fig_dir` plots 
- `table_dir` tables
- `obj_dir` R objects

- `cycif_obj_dir` R objects for cycif data
- `cycif_fig_dir` plots for cycif data
