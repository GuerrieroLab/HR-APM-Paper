## Relationship between estrogen receptor signaling and immune evasion

This repository contains codes used for a manuscript, Shimada *et al.*, **"An estrogen receptor signaling transcriptional program linked to immune evasion in human hormone receptor-positive breast cancer"**.


Note:
Certain paths were set in `.Rprofile` file, which is not shared in this repository. 

To reproduce the codes, a user should prepare the following in one's environment.

- `data_dir` raw data, flat files (txt, csv) mostly
- `fig_dir` plots 
- `table_dir` tables
- `obj_dir` R objects
